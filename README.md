- What kind of data do you have?
  - Points
    - How much data?
      - Just enough
        - Convert the data to GeoJSON & make a simple Leaflet map
      - Too much in a confusing way, but each points data is important?
        - Cluster your points with [Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)
      - Too much and the points have some value that can be aggregated
        - Create hexbins of your points with the [QGIS hexbin](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/binning-alternative-point-maps/) plugin, to make
          polygons. Start again at Polygons
      - Too much and the points just represent presence - like tweets
        - Create a heatmap with [Leaflet.heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat) or QGIS heatmap plugin. If you
          use QGIS heatmap, start again at Raster.
      - Tons of data, and you don't need labels? Use [datamaps](https://github.com/ericfischer/datamaps).
  - Polygons
    - How much data?
      - Just enough
        - Convert the data to [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) & make a simple Leaflet map
      - Too much, the polygons have necessary detail
        - Use TileMill to render an interactive map with [UTFGrid](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/utfgrid/)
      - Too much, the polygons have unnecessary details
        - Simplify them with [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) or QGIS
    - What kind of attributes do they have?
      - Absolute numbers
        - Convert the points to centroids with [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/) and start from Points
        - Normalize absolutes to rates by dividing over polygon area,
          and start from Rates
      - Rates or Categories
        - Make a choropleth map with Leaflet for small data, [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)
          for big data
      - Temporal data - values over time
        - If there are fewer than 100 samples - like 50 years of data grouped by year, make [small multiples](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/20/us/drought-footprint.html): a map per sample.
        - If you can code, make an animation with Leaflet or d3
        - If it's tons of data, use [CartoDB and torque](http://blog.cartodb.com/post/66687861735/torque-is-live-try-it-on-your-cartodb-maps-today)
      - Multivariate data: like counts of different species or ethnicities
        - Make a [dot density map](http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/index.html) with [englewood](https://github.com/newsapps/englewood)
  - Lines
    - Small amounts of data: use [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
    - Lots of data, or need line labels (are they streets?)? Use [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/)
    - Tons of data, and you don't need line labels? Use [datamaps](https://github.com/ericfischer/datamaps).
  - Raster
    - Render a map with [TileMill](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/) and use the tiles in Leaflet
    - Read [processing satellite imagery](https://www.mapbox.com/foundations/processing-satellite-imagery/) to understand GDAL/ImageMagick workflow.
  - Names of places, like countries
    - With IDs:
      - ISO2 or ISO3 codes
        - Download [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data at the right level, join with QGIS,
          and start again at Polygons
      - ZIP codes
        - Download [ZCTAs](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html) and join
    - Without IDs
      - Find data with IDs, or manually join with polygons
  - Addresses
    - You can't map addresses directly. Geocode them with [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) or
      [Geo for Google Docs](https://www.mapbox.com/geo-for-google-docs/), and then start at Points
    - Other Geocoding options:
      - [forrest](http://tristen.ca/forrest/) (Mapbox)
      - [geocod.io](http://geocod.io/)
      - [nominatim](http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)
  - A format that I can't read
    - Install [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) and use ogr2ogr to convert the file
    - Ask your source for a better file format
  - I don't have data yet
    - Contact the town or federal GIS dept you need
    - Use [FOIAMachine.org](https://www.foiamachine.org/) to request data via FOIA
    - If you want to create data, use [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) and draw it.

- Visualization defaults
  - Projection:
    - If it's a web map with tiles, use [Spherical Mercator](http://epsg.io/3857)
    - If using [d3](http://d3js.org/) and not using tiles anywhere, use whatever fits best. Bonus projections are in [d3-geo-projection](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection).
    - Have a project and not sure what it is? Use [epsg.io](http://epsg.io/3857).
  - Colors:
    - When in doubt, use [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/)
    - Want to know more? Read [Subtleties of Color](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/05/subtleties-of-color-part-1-of-6/)
  - Scales:
    - For any data
      - Try linear first
      - Then quantile
    - For data of rates or compounding values
      - Try log and power scales
  - Points:
    - Start with normal circles with no strokes
    - Scale points by area, not diameter
  - Flair:
    - Only add a north arrow if north isn't up
    - Always attribute your data, especially [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), to avoid the nerd wrath
    - If it zooms, add visible zoom controls. Pan isn't necessary, but not everyone has a scroll wheel / multitouch
